Source code for CGC Farming Simulator - cgcstats.com

This is the private repository for the CGC Farming Simulator curated by Helliarc.  

The CGC Farming Simulator is a utility website intended to simulate the stats of farming Catgirl NFTs under various conditions.  It is not affiliated at all with the Catgirl.io, Catgirl Coin, or Catgirl NFT development team. 

This repository is currently private to keep participation limited to only interested parties, it is intended to reach "public" status once a baseline 1.0 version is established by those involved in the first iteration of the private repository.

The CGC Farming Simulator is a PAGE of the cgcstats.com website.  Additional features and data will be added as progress is made.  Such features include graphs tracking price data/trends/other relatable data, a live Catgirl NFT Table, wallet log-in, saving/loading farm data, and other features.  Ideas and contributions are welcome!  If you are a PROFESSIONAL web developer, please refrain from "leet code solutions", most contributors to this tool are Junior level or less, instead please provide constructive feedback and recommendations to problems and features of the site.  We'd prefer your expertise be in a mentorship role.  

Most communication about this project will be done on Discord by contacting user: Helliarc#6666 If you would like to get involved, add a friend/collegue to the private repository, or ask before making a change, feel free to contact him at any time for whatever reason.
