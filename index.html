        <p class="pinfo">Currently this website is under massive construction and is maintained as a "living" Alpha for learning and entertainment.  Features of this website will include on-chain statistics as they relate to the CatgirlCoin 
            Token and it's communities.  Additional features will include a "Farming Simulator", a "NekoFuse Simulator", and other wallet connection features to store your experience on this website(in an optional fashion).</p>
        <h3 class="listhead">Features and their descriptions:</h3>
        <ol class="featurelist">
            <li class="farmsimlnk"><a href="farmingsimulator.html">The Farming Simulator</a> - This is what started it all. Current functionality of the Catgirl.io website limits your ability to "plug and play" speculative farming arrangements.  
                What will your total Farming Power be if you farm this NFT?  How much $PAW do I need to farm this arrangement of my NFTs?  This feature answers these questions and many more!  Take a look!</li>
            <li class="cgcstatslnk"><a href="cgcstats.html">CatgirlCoin Stats</a> - Viewing stats on the CatgirlCoin Token can be a drag, clicking this link, then clicking this link, then comparing data in an excel spreadsheet to THIS link... 
            I've decided to do that legwork for you and display statistical information in a central place!  Circulating supply minus burn.  CGC/BNB and CGC/USD pairs(and their graphs!). Liquidity Pool token information.  Current Total Farming Power.  
            And many, many more! Stay tuned for this one!</li>
            <li class="fusesimlnk"><a href="fusesimulator.html">NekoFuse Simulator</a> - This tool definitely takes the *burn* out of burning NFTs...  But like any game of chance, people love to "practice" before they play!  No Maes will be harmed 
                in this process.</li>
